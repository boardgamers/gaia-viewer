# gaia-viewer
A Vue.js / SVG UI for Gaia Project

**Used to maintain the old UI. The new repo is [HERE](https://github.com/boardgamers/gaia-project)**

## Demo

Check out [boardgamers.space](https://www.boardgamers.space)!

## Requirements

Depending on your version of node and your OS, the binaries for node-sass might need to be built rather than downloaded.

This can generally be avoided if you have a LTS version of node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/.

If you have errors during `npm install` due to manually building modules, you can try this:

### Windows

```bash
# From an elevated powershell / admin console
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

### Mac

- install python 2.7 + (not 3.x)
- run `xcode-select --install` in the terminal

See [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) for why.

### Unix

```bash
sudo apt install build-essentials
```

## Build

```bash
yarn install
yarn serve
```

And open localhost:8080 in the browser.

You will also need to run gaia-engine on the same machine.

## Include in other projects

For now there are three ways to include the viewer:

- By importing individual components: If you want to integrate into an existing Vue APP, for example
- Through `index.ts`, the default export is the `launch` function: The viewer will create its own Vue App on the given selector
- Through `unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer`, which will set `window.gaiaViewer` or `global.gaiaViewer`. Here is an example:

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/vue@^2/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/bootstrap-vue@^2/dist/bootstrap-vue.min.js"></script>

<script source="//unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer">
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer/dist/package/viewer.css">
```

If you want something else, contact us.

### launch function

The default export, and `window.gaiaViewer.launch` / `global.gaiaViewer.launch` when included via a `script` tag, is a function taking a css selector as an argument. When executed, it instantiates a Game on the aformentioned element, and returns an `EventEmitter` that can be communicated with.

The EventEmitter has this interface:

```js
// Give the new game data to the viewer
emitter.emit('state', gameData);
// Update preferences
emitter.emit('preferences', {noFactionFill: true});
// Set player - choose either. If no player is set, then everyone can play
// in the same window
emitter.emit('player', {auth: "xxx"});
emitter.emit('player', {index: 0});
// Listen for move actions
emitter.on('move', (move) => {/* send move to backend and give back result */});
// Signals that a player's name was clicked
emitter.on('player:clicked', ({name, index, auth}) => {/* ... */});
```

If you want a self-contained game which plays in the browser with no interaction with your code, you can do:

```js
// via <script>
window.gaiaViewer.launchSelfContained("#my-selector");

// via import
import {launchSelfContained} from '@gaia-project/viewer';
```

# gaia-viewer
A Vue.js / SVG UI for Gaia Project

**MOVED TO https://github.com/boardgamers/gaia-project**

## Demo

Check out [boardgamers.space](https://www.boardgamers.space)!

## Build and Run

```bash
# install deps, do this everytime yarn.lock is modified
yarn install
# run
yarn serve
```

And open localhost:8080 in the browser.

You can change [src/self-contained.ts](src/self-contained.ts) to change the initial setup: number of players, factions...

## Use local engine

Download and install `gaia-engine`.

In `gaia-engine`'s folder:

```
yarn link
```

In `gaia-viewer`'s folder

```
yarn link @gaia-project/engine
```

Now your gaia-viewer will use your local engine, instead of the one on NPM

## Include in other projects

For now there are three ways to include the viewer:

- By importing individual components: If you want to integrate into an existing Vue APP, for example
- Through `index.ts`, the default export is the `launch` function: The viewer will create its own Vue App on the given selector
- Through `unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer`, which will set `window.gaiaViewer` or `global.gaiaViewer`. Here is an example:

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/vue@^2/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/bootstrap-vue@^2/dist/bootstrap-vue.min.js"></script>

<script source="//unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer">
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@gaia-project/viewer/dist/package/viewer.css">
```

If you want something else, contact us.

### launch function

The default export, and `window.gaiaViewer.launch` / `global.gaiaViewer.launch` when included via a `script` tag, is a function taking a css selector as an argument. When executed, it instantiates a Game on the aformentioned element, and returns an `EventEmitter` that can be communicated with.

The EventEmitter has this interface:

```js
// Give the new game data to the viewer
emitter.emit('state', gameData);
// Update preferences
emitter.emit('preferences', {noFactionFill: true});
// Set player - choose either. If no player is set, then everyone can play
// in the same window
emitter.emit('player', {auth: "xxx"});
emitter.emit('player', {index: 0});
// Listen for move actions
emitter.on('move', (move) => {/* send move to backend and give back result */});
// Signals that a player's name was clicked
emitter.on('player:clicked', ({name, index, auth}) => {/* ... */});
```

If you want a self-contained game which plays in the browser with no interaction with your code, you can do:

```js
// via <script>
window.gaiaViewer.launchSelfContained("#my-selector");

// via import
import {launchSelfContained} from '@gaia-project/viewer';
```
